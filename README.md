## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload**: The user uploads a legal document in PDF format via a clean, simple interface.
2. **Analyze**: The frontend sends the document to a Python Flask backend. The backend extracts the text and sends it to the Gemini API with a specialized prompt to analyze it.
3. **Display**: The structured analysis (summary, risks, clauses) is returned to the frontend and displayed in an interactive dashboard. The user can view the original PDF and the AI's insights simultaneously.
4. **Interact & Download**: The user can ask follow-up questions or download the complete analysis as a high-quality PDF report.

## ☁️ Deployment on Render

### Part 1: Deploying the Python Backend (Web Service)

1. **Add Gunicorn**: Add this line to your `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   gunicorn
   ```
2. **Push to GitHub**: Create a new repository and push your files.
3. **Create a Render Account**: Sign up at [Render](https://render.com).
4. **Deploy Backend**:
   - Name: `un-law-backend`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn main:app`
   - Add environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
5. **Copy Backend URL** once deployed.

### Part 2: Deploying the Frontend (Static Site)

1. Update API URLs in `index.html` (replace `http://127.0.0.1:5000` with your Render backend URL).
2. Commit & push changes.
3. Deploy as a **Static Site** on Render.
   - Name: `un-law-frontend`
   - Render will serve your `index.html`.
4. Access your live app at the provided Render URL.
